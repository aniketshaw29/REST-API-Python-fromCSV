Step 1: import all the libraries
	pip install pandas
	pip install flask

Step 2: Our API will have 2 endpoints, 
        the first one is /api/users which will support http methods get, post & delete.
        And the 2nd endpoints /api/books will only support get
        The API should allow us to get a list of all user, register a new user and delete a user.

Step 3: To activate the endpoints we must have minimum 2 methods

Step 4: Now apply main and start the server program

Step 5: Users endpoints
        This function should return all the user only if the request method is GET
